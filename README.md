**Sample Spring MVC Project with JDBC and JSP**

This is a sample project developed as part of learning Spring MVC framework. It demonstrates how to set up a basic Spring MVC application that utilizes JDBC for database connectivity and JSP for the front-end view.

**Features:**
- Implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
- Uses Spring MVC to handle HTTP requests and map them to appropriate controllers.
- Utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for interacting with a database.
- Incorporates JSP (JavaServer Pages) for generating dynamic HTML views.
- Demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JDBC.
- Provides a simple user interface for registering, updating, selecting, and deleting records.

This project aims to serve as a starting point for learning Spring MVC, JDBC, and JSP integration. It showcases how to build a web application with a database backend and provides an understanding of key concepts related to Spring MVC development.

Please note that this is a sample project intended for learning purposes and may not adhere to all best practices or include advanced features. It is meant to serve as a foundation for further exploration and experimentation in Spring MVC development.
